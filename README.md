# DataScience Workshop
A hands-on Data Science workshop was conducted in RVITM. These are the codes we executed using Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook.

In session 1, the dataset was taken from Kaggle website. In session 2, the picture taken during the on-going session is used as an input image.
